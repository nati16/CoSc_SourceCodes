These are the projects I have participated in since I started attending a degree program for __Computer Science__ in _Collage of Natural and Computational Science_
  1. The Note+ is a simple __Java Swing__ based text editor application with undo and redo features.

  2.The Railway Management System is a __console based__ _C++_ application with backup and restore features.

  3.The Student Management System is also another __console based__ __C++__ application that was done to demonstrate the concepts of Data Structure. The goal the system was to do all the data handling on the memory and then store all the data to a simple text editor.
